## Asset Tracking

The asset tracking algorithm combines MLC and FSM (finite state machine) to detect and track package states (stationary upright, stationary not upright, in motion, shaken) as well as events like impact and free-fall.

This solution is indispensable in logistics and supply chain management for real-time package monitoring, industrial automation for tracking materials and equipment, and security systems to detect tampering or mishandling.

Its ability to provide timely and reliable state tracking enhances operational efficiency and security.
