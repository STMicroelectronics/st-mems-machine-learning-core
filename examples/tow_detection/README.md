## Tow detection

The tow detection algorithm is designed for automotive applications to identify two distinct vehicle towing styles: front/back wheel lift and forward/backward lift with a flatbed.

Enabled after the vehicle ignition is turned off, it is highly applicable in automotive security systems to detect unauthorized towing, fleet management solutions for tracking vehicle movement, and insurance systems to monitor towing events.

By providing timely alerts, it ensures vehicle security and proper handling during transportation, reducing the risk of theft or damage.
