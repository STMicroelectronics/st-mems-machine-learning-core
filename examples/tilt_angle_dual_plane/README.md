## Tilt angle dual plane

The dual-plane tilt angle detection algorithm measures two tilt angles, between the x-axis and the horizontal plane and between the y-axis and the horizontal plane.

This solution is particularly advantageous in robotics and industrial automation, where precise angular measurements are critical.
