## 6D position recognition

The 6D position recognition algorithm identifies the orientation of the device: X-axis pointing up, X-axis pointing down, Y-axis pointing up, Y-axis pointing down, Z-axis pointing up, or Z-axis pointing down.

This solution is highly applicable in scenarios where an estimation of the device orientation is needed, for example for smartphones, tablets, e-book readers, and other handheld devices.
