## Activity recognition for mobile

The activity recognition algorithm for mobile is designed for devices such as smartphones. It recognizes stationary, walking, jogging, biking, and driving activities.

This solution is particularly effective for fitness applications that monitor user activity, context-aware applications that adapt based on user behavior (for example, disabling notifications while driving), and health monitoring tools that track activity levels.
