## Door opening/closing/still

The door activity recognition algorithm is designed for door-mounted devices. It identifies three states: closing, opening, and still.

This solution is particularly valuable for smart home systems, security systems that detect unauthorized access, and industrial automation systems that track door usage in factories or warehouses.

Its low-power design makes it ideal for battery-operated devices while ensuring reliable performance.
