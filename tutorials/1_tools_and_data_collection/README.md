![STAIoTCraft logo](images/ST_AIOT_CRAFT/craft_logo.png)

## Data collection tools

Every machine learning core project starts with the collection of data for each class to recognize. In order to train a robust model, a good amount of data should be collected for each class, covering as much as possible all the possible variability (due to different users, different scenarios, etc.). Every datalog should also be long enough so that the pattern is clear and repeats multiple times. In this section, you will find some data logging options using ST's ecosystem.

### Professional MEMS tool & MEMS Studio

This example provides a step-by-step tutorial on how to collect data with the `Professional MEMS tool` board, the `STEVAL-MKI227KA` DIL24 adapter of the LSM6DSV16X sensor and `MEMS Studio`. Find out how to connect and configure your hardware and save your logged data to a file for further use.

1. Connect the ProfiMEMS board with the LSM6DSV16X sensor

    Plug the STEVAL-MKI227KA sensor adapter into the DIL24 socket on the top of the ProfiMEMS board and connect the board to your PC with a USB cable.

2. Open MEMS Studio and connect it to the board

    After opening MEMS Studio, the user is asked to update the firmware of the ProfiMEMS board if it is not up-to-date. After flashing the newest firmware, click on the `Connect` button. When the board is connected, the app shows details about the connected board on the right side. On the left side the user is required to select which device is connected to the ProfiMEMS board: in this example, choose STEVAL-MKI227KA (LSM6DSV16X) and click on `Select`.

    ![MEMSStudio_connection](images/MEMS_Studio/MS_connection_1_6.png)

3. Sensor evaluation

    After the succesful connection, MEMS Studio jumps to `Quick setup` inside `Sensor Evaluation`, where the LSM6DSV16X sensor can be configured. An *Easy Configuration* option is available to set a default configuration for the sensors, or the user can directly configure both the *Output Data Rate* and *Full Scale* settings for both accelerometer and gyroscope.

    The accelerometer configuration for this example is the following:
    - Full Scale: 8 g
    - Output Data Rate: 30 Hz (High Performance mode)

    Since we need only the accelerometer, set the gyroscope in power-down mode and turn Qvar off. It is possible to save this configuration in a `JSON` file in the `Load/Save Configuration` tab to re-use it in the next tutorials. A reference file is available in the *sensor_configuration* folder of this tutorial.

    After the successful sensor configuration press the `â–¶` button in the top left corner to start streaming data from the sensor.

    ![MEMSStudio_sensor_evaluation](images/MEMS_Studio/MS_sensor_evaluation_1_6.png)

    Note: For further sensor configuration, it is possible to configure the sensor using `Registers Map`, which allows direct writing to the sensor registers.

4. Save to file

    Open the `Save to File` tab. Click on `Browse` and add a path where you want to save the data file. In the `Data` section
    select the type of data you want to save. In our example we only need  *Accelerometer* data. From the moment the `Start` button is pressed, MEMS Studio will save the data until the user presses the `Stop` button. Data logging is also indicated by a red dot with actual logging time in the bottom bar of the application.

    In case the user needs a precise time period of data, it is possible to set the `Timeout value`.

    ![MEMSStudio_data_save](images/MEMS_Studio/MS_save_data_1_6.png)

5. Data visualization

    For better control over the data collected, open the `Line Charts` tab with `Motion` page.

    ![MEMSStudio_linecharts](images/MEMS_Studio/MS_data_visualisation_1_6.png)

### NUCLEO-F401RE + X-NUCLEO-IKS4A1 & MEMS Studio

This example demonstrates how colllect data with the `NUCLEO-F401RE` board and the `X-NUCLEO-IKS4A1` expansion board with the LSM6DSV16X sensor using `MEMS Studio`. Find out how to connect and configure your hardware and save your logged data to a file for further use.

1. X-NUCLEO-IKS4A1 hardware configuration

    The LSM6DSV16X sensor is already on the X-NUCLEO-IKS4A1 board. However, it is necessary to have the jumpers correctly configured. We will use configuration `Mode 1: standard I2C bus connection (all sensors)`. Details can be found in section 3.2 of the user manual [UM3239](https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/um3239-getting-started-with-the-xnucleoiks4a1-motion-mems-and-environmental-sensor-expansion-board-for-stm32-nucleo-stmicroelectronics.pdf).

    The board configuration is:
    - J4: 1-2, 11-12 (STM_SDA = SENS_SDA, HUB_SDx = GND)
    - J5: 1-2, 11-12 (STM_SCL = SENS_SCL, HUB_SCx = GND)

    ![mode1](images/mode1_i2c_all_sensors.png)

2. Plug the X-NUCLEO-IKS4A1 expansion board and connect the NUCLEO-F401RE to your PC with a USB cable

3. Flashing firmware

    When the hardware configuration of the X-NUCLEO-IKS4A1 expansion board is done, the next step is to flash the firmware for the NUCLEO-F401RE board. Download the [X-CUBE-MEMS1](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/x-cube-mems1.html#get-software) package, which contains already prebuilt binaries.

    From the X-CUBE-MEMS1 package we will use the **DataLogExtended** firmware, that can be found under *Projects\NUCLEO-F401RE\Examples\IKS4A1\DataLogExtended\Binary\DataLogExtended\Binary*.

    Open the **Firmware Programming** tool in MEMS Studio, click on `Browse` and select the *DataLogExtended.bin* file. When the desired file is selected, start programming clicking on the `Program` button.

4. Connect the NUCLEO-F401RE board to MEMS Studio

    With the firmware successfully flashed it is time to connect the Nucleo board to MEMS Studio. After clicking on the `Connect` button, choose the sensors from the X-NUCLEO-IKS4A1 expansion board. In our case make sure you have chosen LSM6DSV16X as *Accelerometer*. Then click on `Select`.

    ![connect](images/MEMS_Studio/MS_Connect.png)

5. Sensor configuration

    After the sensors have been selected, go to the `Sensor Evaluation` tab. Configure the sensor with `Quick Setup` or use `Register Map` for advanced configuration possibilities.

    It is possible to save the sensor configuration in a `JSON` file in the `Load/Save Configuration` tab to re-use it in the next tutorials. A reference file is available in the *sensor_configuration* folder of this tutorial.

    ![nucleo_sensor_eval](images/MEMS_Studio/MS_sensor_eval_nucleo.png)

6. Data logging

    After the sensor configuration, go to the `Save to File` tab. Click on `Browse` and select a folder where datalogs will be saved. Then choose what kind of data you want to save (*Accelerometer* in this example). Make also sure to set the *Datalog period source* to *Accelerometer* in order to log data synchronously with the sensor data generation signal; this is important to mimic how the data is fed to the MLC. To start collecting data simply click onn the `Start` button. To stop collecting data click on the `Stop` button.

    ![save_to_file](images/MEMS_Studio/MS_save_to_file.png)
